// Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages,
// or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.

// Muhammad Asif - 10/07/2023

const jobSites: string[] = ['Indeed', 'LinkedIn', 'Glassdoor', 'Monster', 'CareerBuilder'];
